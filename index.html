            <em>With</em> well worn eyes and a tested stomach Americans endured another
            grueling election cycle. They chose between an orange populist and a
            didactic democrat, painted as equally vile, evil and corrupt. And so,
            in this quadrennial exercise of freedom, a nation divided in suffrage
            was united again in patriotic syncretism. One can be forgiven for
            having heard this story before, for history is a serial offender
            though not without a sense of humour. For one, loss of faith in
            institutions was a common story during the glory days of the Roman
            Republic. Popularis politicians, Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus,
            exploited the expanding economic and political inequality between
            patricians and plebeians to rise to power as tribunes - promising
            much, delivering little. America though is no Rome. And yet, its
            structural issues are not without precedence.
          </p>
          <p>
            American democracy today is undermined by the triumvirate trends of
            institutional dysfunction, media polarization and a broken campaign
            finance system. Flooded and unable to flush, the great experiment
            flirts with history's unrelenting bend. Falling, but not yet fallen.

          A core innovation of the American presidential system is the balance
          of powers and the various checks on power available to each branch of
          the government. By doing so, unlike in parliamentary democracies, it
          weakens the executive branch relative to the legislative. Madison
          <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch10s16.html" target="_blank">admits</a>
          as much in Federalist 51: 'the defect must be supplied, by so
          contriving the interior structure of the government, as that its
          several constituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the means
          of keeping each other in their proper places'. Furthermore
          plurality-based elections (highest vote getter wins) mean that by
          Duverger's law such an electorate would at most support a two or three
          party system. This diffusion of power in indeed a feature of
          presidential plurality-voting electoral systems leading to less
          centralized decision making structures.
       </p>
       <p>
         Much of the recent political science literature has focused on this
         centralist / decentralist dimension, arguing that the centralized
         structure of parliamentary democracy allows it to be a more reliable
         vehicle to enact good public policy and offers a greater capacity to
         function as a
         <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sthacker/files/2012/01/Are-Parliamentary-Systems-Better.pdf" target="_blank">coordination device</a>.
         A parliamentary democracy, it is argued, integrates a greater diversity of views, provides better
         incentives for actors to reach agreement, allows for fewer
         <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.83.847&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank">veto points</a>
         of obstruction, imposes lower transaction costs on agreements and
         <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~skach/docs/worl_poli.pdf" target="_blank">reduced propensity</a>
         for executives to rule at the edge of the constitution. Presidential democracies
         for their part work well to solve commitment problems (with no threat of
         minority governments) and ensure the durability of victories. This often leads to parliamentary
         systems being considered decisive while presidential systems resolute.
         For much of American history this compromise seemed sufficient,
         reliant as it was on the fidelity of the legislative branch to its voters:

           Three Features of Party Sorting in the United States: First, members
           of the political class initiate the process—they do not sort as a
           response to popular demand; rather, they sort first and the
           (attentive) public takes note and sorts later. Second, sorting
           increases with the level of political involvement—the higher
           the level of political activism, the more distinct (better sorted) are
           Republicans and Democrats. Third, related to the second proposition,
           among typical partisans in the public sorting, has increased but

            Looking at spending differentials (incumbent spending / challenger spending), we see that incumbents outspend their general
            election challengers most in districts they are certain to win. This is done to ward off primary challenges, which
            are often more contentious.

        Perhaps no aspect of this system has received as much media coverage
        as the rise in SuperPAC and dark money spending in recent
        election cycles. Two of the most successful campaigns this cycle -
        that of Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders - started off my making
        it a core campaign message. Its populist appeal aside, the influence
        of wealthy donors is hard to ignore, spreading from federal and
        congressional primaries to more obscure elections in
        <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/9c5844eda43d4e8fa71ba448e73fcb83/are-wealthy-donors-influencing-public-school-agenda" target="_blank">local school boards</a>,

        affecting the Republican party. By some measure the commonality (measured by cosine similarity)
        of the donor bases of congressmen is a
        <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/campaign-donations-reflect-the-sharp-split-in-congress-among-republicans" target="_blank">fair indicator</a>
        of policy preferences and intra-party divisions. Nowhere is this better
        illustrated than in the economic positions of Republican congressmen
        (with respect to taxes on the wealthy, privatization of social
        security and medicare, minimum wage increases, environmental
        regulation etc.), which is often at odds with an overwhelming majority
        of the general electorate. This has led to, as Professor of Political
        Science at Marquette Julia Azari put it: 'the defining
        characteristic of our moment is that parties are weak while
        partisanship is strong'.

           The American two-party system is a creation of the press. “The idea of
           a party system,” as Richard Hofstadter once pointed out, is an
           American invention, one that not only tolerates but requires the
           practice of loyal opposition, political criticism, and organized
           dissent. It began in 1787, during the debate over the Constitution, a
           debate waged in ratifying conventions but also, more thrillingly, in
           the nation’s hundreds of weekly newspapers. Some favored ratification;
           these became Federalist newspapers. Others, the Anti-Federalist
           newspapers, opposed it. If it hadn’t been for the all-or-nothing
           dualism of this choice, the United States might well have a multiparty

        The fall of old media has been as swift as it has been sure. Through
        the deregulation of the FCC in the 80s and the merger mayhem, spurred
        by the Telecom Act, of the 90s American media conglomerates have been
        unrelenting in their pursuit of profit. News is often seen as just
        another segment in the product package with common breaches of the
        wall between entertainment and hard news. Journalism has been replaced
        by infotainment, content that attracts eyeballs and clicks, and in
        that pursuit sacrificed the
        <a href="http://rockyanderson.org/rockycourses/BennettPoliticalEconomyofNews008.pdf" target="_blank">integrity of the fourth estate</a>.
        Often debates are simply framed as hee-haws between public relations
        professionals only too eager to reap the benefits of free media. There
        are today over 5 public relations specialists for each reporter
        compared to 3.2 : 1 in 2004 and 1.2 : 1 in 1980 - it is also the

        <a href="http://www.takepart.com/feature/2015/02/13/pr-jobs-journalism-jobs" target="_blank">chosen destination</a>
        for new graduates. Information is thus produced in generic form,
        wholesaled to outlets that place the appropriate framing to suit the
        format of a particular show or the demographics of its audience.
        The American news system is fast losing its capacity to produce
        independent information that serves the public interest. This dynamic
        is best observed in the insipid coverage of
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtbz_b4hZ4" target="_blank">scientific policy</a>
        in the media. As Nicholas Lemann, dean emeritus of the Columbia
        University Graduate School of Journalism puts it: 'the real problem in
        the world is the decreasing number of employed journalists'.

        Hence entrapped in a deluge of misinformation and partisan
        rhetoric, audiences are less likely to trust sources sharing
        narratives that don't reinforce their beliefs. With Huxleyan irony it
        is not that the truth does not exist, it is that it does not matter -
        such is the price paid for the rational ignorance of the electorate.
        As Americans traverse this brave new world, the words of Neil Postman
        appear divine providence:

          What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of
          'being informed' by creating a species of information that might
          properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the
          precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB.
          Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading
          information - misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial
          information - information that creates the illusion of knowing
          something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying
          this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to
          deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their
          world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that
          is the inevitable result. And in saying that the television news show
          entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious
          than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying
          we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed.
          Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take
          ignorance to be knowledge?

          These long run trends do not foretell epitaphic doom but neither
          are they rationalized as trite aberrations of complex democracies. The
          interplay of these forces deserves to be understood in terms of the
          set of incentives, constraints and feedback loops that are unique to
          the American system of government, politics and media. Understood in
          this context, the rise of Donald Trump is the system's response to the
          global prevailing winds of populism endemic in the aftermath of
          socio-economic crisis.

          This is a two part series in understanding political trends in
          the American democracy and in modelling dynamic equilibrium to
          determine leverage points for policy intervention. Part I examined
          these trends, while Part II will look to model these dynamics and
          examine policy options (or lack thereof). Look for Part II in
          Mar/Apr-2017.

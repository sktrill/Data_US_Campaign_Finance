<p><b>Background</b></p>
With well worn eyes and a tested stomach Americans endured another grueling election cycle. They chose between an orange populist and a didactic democrat, painted as equally vile, evil and corrupt. And so, in this quadrennial exercise of freedom, a nation divided in suffrage was united again in patriotic syncretism. One can be forgiven for having heard this story before, for history is a serial offender though not without a sense of humour. For one, loss of faith in institutions was a common story during the glory days of the Roman Republic. Popularis politicians, Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, exploited the expanding economic and political inequality between patricians and plebeians to rise to power as tribunes - promising much, delivering little. America though is no Rome. And yet, its structural issues are not without precedence. American democracy today is undermined by the triumvirate trends of institutional dysfunction, media polarization and a broken campaign finance system. Flooded and unable to flush, the great experiment flirts with history's unrelenting bend. Falling, but not yet fallen.

<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
To explore trends in the health of American democractic institutions.

<p><b>Datasets</b></p>
From a set of over 100 datasets, the most pertinent were utilized for this analysis. The sets were picked from three decades worth of collected data by the Vital Statistics on Congress project. The project is jointly led by the American Enterprise Institute, Brookings Institute and the Campaign Finance Institute to provide impartial data on America's first branch of government.
